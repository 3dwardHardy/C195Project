Execute the application. Login using your username and password. You'll be notified if there are in upcoming appointments.
You'll have three options to choose from: Customers, Reports, and Appointments.
Selecting the customers button will take you to the customers page, from there you can view the existing customer's information. In the Customers screen you can create, update and delete customers.

The appointment's page shows the upcoming appointments along with the relevant information. These appointments can be sorted by week and month to show a more relevant view. You can also create appointments, update existing appointments and delete appointments using the corresponding buttons located at the bottom of the screen.

The report's page allows you to generate three different types of reports: number of appointments, schedule by Contact ID, and total appointments by Customer ID.

I generated a report of total appointments by Customer ID.
